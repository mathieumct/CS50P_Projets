#### Description:

Hello, my name is Cécile and I am French! My project focuses on MMA through an interactive program. I wanted to share my passion for this sport by diving into the development of this program.

The program offers several features to users, including:

1. An interactive menu with four different options:
   - "Le MMA en bref": provides a quick overview of MMA with summaries and information on different disciplines.
   - "Catégorie de poids": allows users to determine their weight category based on their weight in kilograms.
   - "Glossaire MMA": provides a glossary of commonly used terms in MMA, along with definitions and explanations.
   - "Quitter": allows users to exit the program.

2. Specific functions for each menu option, such as:
   - `mma_brief` function: displays a submenu with two options to learn more about MMA or to quit the program.
   - `brief_resume` function: presents a brief summary of MMA in paragraph form. It is part of the mma_brief submenu.
   - `different_arts` function: displays a list of different disciplines present in MMA. I tried to make this list readable, clear, and spacious for easier reading.
   - `categorie_poids` function: determines the user's weight category.
   - `glossaire_mma` function: presents an interactive glossary of MMA terms and definitions. Users will also have the option to save terms to print later from a favorites list.

At one point, I found myself facing a dilemma regarding the testing of my various functions. I had originally implemented them so that they directly printed the result instead of returning it. So, I made the decision to revise my entire program to modify it so that printing is done in the main() function, allowing me to easily test each of my functions.

This project represents for me an opportunity to combine my passion for MMA with my Python programming skills. I hope you enjoy discovering this program as much as I enjoyed creating it!
